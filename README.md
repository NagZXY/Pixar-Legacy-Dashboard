# Pixar-Legacy-Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Disney-Pixar’s feature films, exploring their financial performance, audience reception, and industry impact.

The Overview Page presents key details of each film, offering a snapshot of Pixar’s storytelling evolution.
The Film Report Page highlights top-performing movies based on revenue, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores, and other metrics like longest runtime and most nominations. It also visualizes the correlation between critical reception and revenue using a bubble chart and examines genre distribution through a pie chart.
Lastly, the Revenue Report delves into Pixar’s global box office performance, comparing contributions from the U.S. & Canada versus the rest of the world. It also analyzes revenue by director, identifies the most profitable films, and ranks movies by return on investment (ROI). This analysis uncovers key insights into Pixar’s legacy and success over the years.
